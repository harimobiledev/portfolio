# [Dhyana: Meditation Tracker](https://apps.apple.com/in/app/dhyana-meditation-tracker/id1471290028)
Dhyana is meditation application (RxSwift, MVVM-C): Being built using Reactive and MVVM-C, tracks user's heart rate with in-house heart rate monitor via CoreBluetooth framework. App entirely developed in trending Neumorphic theme. Project follows frameworks based modular structure With UI build using Storyboards and SwiftUI.

I'm extremely pleased with how the project came out. I'm particularly proud of the app's animation, UI design, and easily-extended architecture (MVVM-Coordinators). Dhyana is built with Xcode and written entirely in Swift 5. Dhyana is my ongoing project.
